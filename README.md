# Hi, I'm Rayees 👋

## 🤖 AI Automation & Agent Builder

I build **practical AI agents and workflow automations** that solve real operational problems — from task orchestration to support workflows and productivity systems.

### 🔧 What I’m working on
- AI agents for operations & support workflows  
- Automation using APIs, LLMs, and no/low-code tools  
- Task orchestration, ticket handling, and workflow optimization  
- Open-source AI experiments & utilities  

### 🧠 Background
I come from a **project coordination & operations** background (5+ years), which helps me design AI systems that actually work in real businesses — not just demos.

### 🛠 Tech & Tools
- LLMs: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini  
- Automation: APIs, Webhooks, Zapier / Make  
- Platforms: GitHub, Notion, Google Workspace  
- AI Tools: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gamma  

### 📌 Goals
- Publish reusable AI agents  
- Share automation templates  
- Collaborate on open-source AI projects
