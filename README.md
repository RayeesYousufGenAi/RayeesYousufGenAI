# Hi, I'm Rayees 👋

## 🤖 AI Automation & Agent Builder

I build **practical AI agents and workflow automations** that solve real operational problems — from task orchestration and ticket handling to productivity and service workflows.

My focus is on **usable, production-minded AI**, not just demos.
